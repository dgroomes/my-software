# mcp

Learning and exploring Model Context Protocol (MCP) and the tooling around it.


## Wish List

* [x] DONE Nu-based MCP server.
   * Done with caveats. It's not a server. I need a Bash wrapper. That's ok.
* [x] DONE Reduce the Nu MCP server. How small can I reasonably get without being obscure?
* [ ] I need an actually useful MCP server. Maybe one for my "Wish List" sections (which are TODO sections). Read and
  write?
