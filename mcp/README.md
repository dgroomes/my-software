# mcp

Learning and exploring Model Context Protocol (MCP) and the tooling around it.


## Wish List

* [x] DONE Nu-based MCP server.
   * Done with caveats. It's not a server. I need a Bash wrapper. That's ok.
* [x] DONE Reduce the Nu MCP server. How small can I reasonably get without being obscure?
* [ ] IN PROGRESS I need an actually useful MCP server. Maybe one for my "Wish List" sections (which are TODO sections). Read and
  write?
    * IN PROGRESS Start a "Wish List" MCP server. Scaffold it.
    * "Wish List" MCP server: We need a 'find "Wish List" and "TODO" sections" tool
    * "Wish List" MCP server: We need a 'rank and summarize top wish list items" tool
    * "Wish List" MCP server: We need a 'edit wish list item" tool
    * Consider fleshing out 'engage' with few shot examples. Consider renaming it to 'start_here'.
    * Note: already as I'm starting this I'm realizing I'm missing the ability to have state in my server process. Hmm,
      learning. I want to keep track of if "engage" was used before for the session.
