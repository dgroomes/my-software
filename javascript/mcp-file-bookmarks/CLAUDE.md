# Workflow

* Always read the full file contents of files in 'src/' before working on code. This is a small project. You can affort to read everything.


# Miscellaneous

* We are depending on the LLM to do smart things. We need to teach the LLM how to use the tools, by way of good instructions/tool-descriptions. Never write "bookmark matching heuristic" code that does stuff like keyword string matching. That's a smell that you're not using the LLM for what it's good at and instead relying on old school thinking.
