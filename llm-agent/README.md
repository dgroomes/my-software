My personal rules for LLM agents like Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, etc.

I'm still learning what is effective. I'm trying to keep things short, especially because that's the constant advice from people at Anthropic, etc. It's a balance between simple (quint but probably effective) and complex (ambitious but probably inconsistently followed).
