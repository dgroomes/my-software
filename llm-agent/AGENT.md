# Miscellaneous

* Pay special attention to the "Wish List" section of the README to anchor your work on the "IN PROGRESS" task if it exists.
* You DO NOT have access to Nushell, only Bash. Don't try to run the commands in `.nu` files. You should study the `do.nu` file as reference, however.
* Never try to delete files yourself, instead ask me to do it.
* Never delete existing comments. When re-writing code, always keep the original comments.
* Never add your own comments unless they are explaining some cryptic or unusual code.
