## Done

These are items from the *Wish List* section in the README which are considered done. I'm keeping them version controlled for posterity. I'd like to be able to see the range of content I've worked on, and also have some searchability.

Before I decided to version control this content, I had actually just deleted it in this commit <https://github.com/dgroomes/my-software/commit/545de5778421eabe24b787ef10441408b86c4eed>. But now I'd like to keep it.

- [x] DONE Spring cleaning. There's quite a bit of stuff I've been holding onto because I thought I might use it or complete but haven't. I need to lean this codebase out. I can delete it and it'll still be in vcs. So let's do it.
    * DONE Delete whole sub-projects and track them in a "consider revising" with list item
    * DONE Remove finished wish list items. This one hurts a little... but they take up context windows and my own space too. Gotta drop it. It's still minable in vcs.
