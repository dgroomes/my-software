# python

Python code that supports my personal workflows.


## Overview

This directory contains Python-based utilities and tools organized into subdirectories, each representing an independent
project with its own dependencies and configuration.


## Wish List

General clean-ups, TODOs and things I wish to implement for this project:

* [ ] Consider compacting. The `token_count:token_count:token_count` administration is too verbose, for example. Can we
  compress this? Is UV good for this? Single file programs with the metadata in the block comment at the top? I don't
  have a need for shared Python code right now and I'm not sure Python monorepo tooling is good at this point. Stick to
  individual projects.
