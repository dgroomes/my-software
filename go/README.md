# go

Go code that supports my personal workflows.


## Overview

To develop the Go code in this directory, I open this directory in the GoLand IDE. I won't bother trying to use Intellij
to develop Go. I've found, for example, that developing Python in Intellij is troublesome and I prefer to use PyCharm.
Same story for Android development, just use Android Studio.

Note: I might consider building and publishing binaries using GitHub Actions, and then installing them via Homebrew, but
for now, `go install` should work fine for me.


## `my-launcher`

`my-launcher` launches Java programs by finding and invoking the correct version `java` installed on the system.
It depends on a `my-manifest.json` file that describes the exact version of Java, the classpath, the main class, and
other Java system properties, etc. This is an alternative to the Gradle [`application` plugin](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/application_plugin.html)
which creates a shell *start script* that encodes all this same info. I use the `application` plugin very frequently,
but now, I need to eject from Posix shell and get finer control and better legibility. So I'm going with a "Go
binary + JSON manifest" as a Java program launcher.


## `my-fuzzy-finder`

`my-fuzzy-finder` is a commandline fuzzy finder with a JSON API. It's designed to have a similar user experience to
`fzf`.

I think `fzf` really got the UX right, and it's been replicated in many tools. The main feature I'm missing from `fzf`
is the ability to have structured input and output. I use [Nushell](https://www.nushell.sh/) which is a shell that uses
structured data, and the more that my tools can support structured data, the better.

When it comes to matching on [multi-line items in `fzf`, you can do it](https://junegunn.github.io/fzf/tips/processing-multi-line-items/),
but you have to ditch the familiar newline-delimited model and instead use a `NUL`-delimited model. Some tools support
this out-of-the-box, like `find`, which has the `-print0` option. But for many other tools, you have to retrofit their
output with some scripting. For me, I can afford to shape my tools to use structured data instead of injecting this
structure in an ad-hoc way. I want to avoid particularly gnarly stringly-typed programming.

`my-fuzzy-finder` is a TUI (text user interface) program built using these excellent projects:

- The [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) TUI framework
- The [Bubbles](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbles) TUI component library
- The "fuzzy" library <https://github.com/sahilm/fuzzy>.

## `go-body-omitter/`

`go-body-omitter` is a Go program that strips function bodies from Go source code. It's designed to help you jam Go
software into an LLM, where you would otherwise not be able to fit the original program into the context window because
it's too many tokens.

I'm interested, in general, in "explain a codebase to me and help me explore it tools", like Sourcegraph + Cody. I've
explored those. Right now, I'm getting big leverage out of direct AI Chat and I can use AI Chat to build a small program
that can help me read larger programs that can help me build larger programs.


## Instructions

Follow these instructions to build, run and install my software.

1. Activate the Nushell `do` module
    * ```nushell
      do activate
      ```
2. Build and test the code:
    * ```nushell
      do test
      ```
3. Build and run the `my-fuzzy-finder` program with the example data:
    * ```nushell
      do run my-fuzzy-finder --example
      ```
    * Next, try fuzzy finding among the filenames in the current directory.
    * ```nushell
      ls | get name | str join (char newline) | do run my-fuzzy-finder
      ```
    * The output will be the selected filename.
    * Next, try a similar thing but with the JSON API. This takes a JSON array in and sends JSON out. The advantage of
      using a JSON array for input is that the items can have multiple lines, whereas in the typical newline-delimited
      input, your items can only be exactly one line.
    * ```nushell
      ["Hello, world!" "Dear reader,
      Hello.
      Sincerely, writer"] | to json | do run my-fuzzy-finder --json-in --json-out
      ```
    * It will output the selected filename but also the index of that item in the input list. It will look something
      like the following.
    * ```json
      {"index": 1, "item": "Dear reader,\nHello.\nSincerely, writer"}
      ```
    * Finally, try the program and enable debugging. The logs are printed to a local `my-fuzzy-finder.log` file.
    * ```nushell
      do run my-fuzzy-finder --example --debug
      ```
4. Build and run `go-body-omitter`:
    * ```nushell
      r#'
      package main
      
      import "fmt"
      
      func main() {
        fmt.Println("hello")
      }
      '# | do run go-body-omitter
      ```
    * The output should look like the following.
    * ```text
      package main
      
      import "fmt"
      
      func main() {
          // OMITTED      
      }
      ```
    * Try other incantations, like the following. This one shows the effect of the shrink.
    * ```nushell
      fd --extension go | wrap file |
        insert tokens { |row| open --raw $row.file | token-count | into int } |
        insert tokens-after-omission { |row| open --raw $row.file | do run go-body-omitter | token-count | into int } |
        sort-by --reverse tokens
      ```
    * It outputs the following:
    * | file                                  | tokens | tokens-after-omission |
      |---------------------------------------|--------|-----------------------|
      | pkg/my-fuzzy-finder/main.go           | 3977   | 1427                  |
      | pkg/my-fuzzy-finder-lib/fuzzy.go      | 1797   | 667                   |
      | pkg/my-fuzzy-finder-lib/fuzzy_test.go | 1246   | 33                    |
      | pkg/go-body-omitter/main.go           | 326    | 111                   |
5. Try `posix-nushell-compatibility-checker`:
    * ```nushell
      'echo "hello there" world' | do run posix-nushell-compatibility-checker
      ```
    * The exit code should be 0, indicating that the `echo ...` command is interpreted the same between POSIX and Nushell.
6. Build all executables:
    * ```nushell
      do build
      ```
    * The executables (i.e. `my-launcher`, `my-fuzzy-finder`) will be in the `bin/` directory. Try them out as needed to
      do validation and exploration. If you are satisfied, then you can install the executables globally with the next
      step.
7. Build and install the executables to your `GOBIN`:
    * ```nushell
      do install
      ```
    * Now you can run the executables, like `my-launcher`, from anywhere on your system.


## Wish List

General clean-ups, TODOs and things I wish to implement for this project:

* [ ] Need to handle items that exceed the full height?
* [ ] Workaround `./` parsing gap of the new Nushell parser.
* [ ] Make a Node launcher for JavaScript programs. This would be similar to `my-launcher` but for Node.js. If this works
  nicely, I'll rename `my-launcher` to `my-java-launcher`. I don't see a compelling reason to couple a Node launcher with
  the Java launcher, especially because of the schema, there would be conflicting possible options like specifying a
  Java classpath while also specifying a Node version. Those don't go together. In the day and age of quick,
  context-window-amenable programs tailored for LLM copilot, small/focused is good.
   * I need to advertise Node homes in an environment variable. What's a conventional name for this? In Java we use
     `JAVA_HOME`.


## Finished Wish List Items

* [x] DONE Scaffold a "hello world" program
* [x] DONE Implement `my-launcher`
* [x] DONE Implement `my-fuzzy-finder`
    * DONE I need to start paring things down. Start with getting rid of most keybindings.
      * DONE Let's get rid of the pagination first.
    * DONE "enter" to complete the program.
    * DONE "esc" to quit the program without a selection. Use an exit status.
    * DONE (removed) What is the status message?
    * DONE Drop the spinner
    * DONE Copy in textinput and pare it down.
      * I do really like the `ctrl+u` / `ctrl+e` / `ctrl+a` keybindings that it supports. That's a nice tough. But I don't need a
        lot of it.
    * DONE Is there a way to not leave the filtering input? I always want to be able to type and move down/up/enter. 
    * DONE Pare down DefaultFilter
    * DONE Pare down item interface stuff
    * (partially done) Pare down (inline) styles
* [x] DONE Re-use the `textinput` Bubbles component and in general compress the code 
* [x] DONE (fixed/obsoleted by other refactoring) Re-size defect. When resizing and then moving the cursor, the program panics.
* [x] DONE Support multi-line
* [x] OBSOLETE (Somehow resolved on itself. Not sure why) Support special (longer unicode?) characters like `Â°` in the underline highlighting.
* [x] DONE Defect: Get cursor blinking working again.
* [x] DONE Support JSON array input
* [X] DONE (Big restructuring but great result) Defect: beginning content is cut off. I think it's cutting off by as many additional lines there are per item
  beyond the first line. So a 2-line item will because 1 line to be cut off. The 'Filter: ' text input is missing, for
  example.
* [x] OBSOLETE (Already works, the content is just truncated, that's good) items that exceed the full width
* [x] DONE Support 'fzf' search syntax.
* [x] DONE (Update 2: I'm going to pare it down. A hard fork. Update 1: Alternatively, it might best to just do a shallow fork so that I can preserve the diff better. Not sure.) Pare down 'fzf' code. Thankfully I was able to get fzf integration without many (half?) of the original source
  code. But still, I should be able to trim it down much more (and learn it).
    * DONE Remove caching
    * DONE consolidate item.go
    * More ...
* [x] DONE Case-insensitive
* [x] DONE Split into `my-fuzzy-finder-lib/` and `my-fuzzy-finder/` packages
* [x] DONE Tests.
* [x] SKIP (Update: well I don't want to deal with multiple outputs) Yeah I think I'd like this, just to be able to test, especially for more complex expressions) Consider supporting headless mode. But really, `fzf` should be fine for that.
* [x] DONE Support/fix the logical OR operator
* [x] DONE Can the algo be agnostic of case sensitivity?
* [x] DONE What's up with whitespace handling?
* [x] DONE Less pre-slicing
* [x] PARTIAL (Unfortunately the new Nushell parser is missing a critical mass of cases) posix-nushell-compatibility-checker. For prototypical commands (command plus string args) I don't want the
  noise of the Nu raw string. Just allow the original command to exist. 
   * DONE Scaffold.
   * DONE (Idk I think they are just there and that's fine) What are the top-level `*syntax.File` and `syntax.Stmt` types? Are those just always there?
   * I really need to parse Nushell as well. Because what looks like a string literal in shell could be interpolation
     in Nushell for example. I need to parse the expression for both langs (shell/Nu) and assert that they are both
     "boring cmd + string args". I don't need to support any more cases. This is better than 80/20, this is like 95/5.
   * DONE Scaffold a Rust program that uses the Nu parser.
   * DONE Call the Rust program from the Go program.
   * DONE Parse the output of the Rust program (just JSON into a map)
   * DONE Match the expressions (shell/Nu) for compatibility. This should be driven by tests, because it's subtle and maybe
     wide.
* [x] DONE `go-body-omitter`
   * DONE generate a first pass (o1-preview did a great job)
   * SKIP (fine enough for now) Study the generated code. Consider changes/comments/restructuring. Should we omit in a more nuanced way?
* [ ] SKIP (no, I'm not doing any scoring/bonus at all) Consider ranking "exact matches" before fuzzy matches? If I type "rea" I want to see "README.md" appear before
  "gradlew.bat".
