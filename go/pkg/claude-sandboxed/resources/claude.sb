;; Seatbelt profile for Claude Code
(version 1)

;; I would prefer to do 'deny default' but I'm getting errors in Node.js. Until I can figure out the exact things it needs, I'll use default settings and target my "known knowns".
(allow default)

;; Broadly prohibit file write access
(deny file-write*)

(allow file-write*
    ;; Allow writing to the current project
    (subpath (param "PROJECT_DIR"))

    ;; Claude Code does administrative stuff in ~/.claude.json and ~/.claude
    (literal (param "CLAUDE_JSON_PATH"))
    (subpath (param "CLAUDE_DIR"))

    ;; A conventional file I use for debugging my Bash initialization
    (literal (param "SHELL_DEBUG_LOG_PATH")))

;; I'm not totally sure if these are needed but probably
(allow file-write-data
    (literal "/dev/stdout")
    (literal "/dev/stderr")
    (literal "/dev/null"))

;; Broadly deny network access  and the port used for the OAuth flow
(deny network*)
(allow network-outbound
    (remote tcp "localhost:9051") ;; claude-proxy
    (remote tcp "localhost:54545") ;; OAuth flow. Not sure this is needed. Maybe only inbound is needed.
)
(allow network-inbound  (local  tcp "localhost:54545")) ;; OAuth flow

;; Talk to the security/trust daemons
;; Not sure these are needed but think so because Claude Code uses keychain for API key or OAuth?
(allow mach-lookup
       (global-name "com.apple.securityd")
       (global-name "com.apple.trustd"))
