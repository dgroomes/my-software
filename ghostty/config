# Use Nushell as the shell. For a while, I had Nushell configured as the login shell. There are advantages to doing
# that, like being able to omit the "command" configuration here because Ghostty would automatically use the login
# shell. But there are disadvantages too, like some tooling that makes assumptions and has functionality around specific
# shells, like what VSCode does to set environment variables: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/45210d22bf99200859147c92ec0db2ce9afb50ea/src/vs/platform/shell/node/shellEnv.ts#L102
# I don't want to use Nushell in VSCode or Intellij because they have aggresively implemented interactions in their
# terminal emulators that usually only work in traditional shells like Bash/Zsh/POSIX.
#
# I'm finding that it's wise to use a traditional shell like Bash as the login shell, and then explicitly configuring
# tools like Ghostty to use Nushell.
