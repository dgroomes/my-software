# My customizations for zoxide.
#
# zoxide is designed to be used with 'z' and 'zi' (interactive) commands. I'm inspired by this flow, but adapting the
# frontend experience to my own needs. Specifically, I'm only interested in interactive mode, so I can use the coveted
# single-character 'z' command to launch an interactive search. zoxide is designed to use 'fzf' but I'll use my own
# 'fz' search frontend, which is implemented with BubbleTea.
#
# I imagine there's value in having upfront options to the "interactive cd" experience, but honestly, I'm so used to
# basic 'cd' that I don't have the imagination for that yet. I'm only jumping to 'an interactive cd' experience based
# on the 'frecency' score (frequency + recency. See https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide/wiki/Algorithm#frecency) of
# the directories I've visited. zoxide is doing the heavy lifting on
# the backend to keep a database, update it on every directory change, and calculate the frecency score.
