# strategy

My software strategy. Think things like tech radar, tech stack synergy, etc.


## Overview

This is a **work in progress**. I need a space to collect and organize ideas and note that make up my so-called "software strategy". This strategy doc has a stream-of-consciousness tinge to it. That's fine. In a way, it's just meant to be a launching pad, scratchpad or temporary scaffold to produce something more enduring, which is my collection of software subprojects.

In 2026, agentic AI is the 600 pound gorilla that needs to be included in the strategy. One of my focus areas is sandboxing. I get so much value from agentic coding collaborators like Claude Code, Codex, GitHub Copilot, and there's so much more value to squeeze out of them if only I could let them work for longer task horizons and without oversight.

I've explored sandboxing items like macOS seatbelt. I've thought a lot about running it in a Docker container or running it in a VM. What I want to do is keep fleshing out these an understanding of these tools and working them, trying them out in my own workflow. For various reasons, there's no clear winner because of the fast accumulation of complexity when you adopt these tools. This is a high cost. Consider on macOS, you can't even run containers, you have to run them by way of a virtual machine, Docker Desktop, Colima, all these things have layers to them that require constant updates, filling up a mental model, compatibility, etc.

Seatbelt itself is deprecated. I really don't have a strong sense of what the right tool is, I just need to get going. I explored running macOS VMs using Tart in 2025, but I barely scratched the surface. Recently, I did Docker in Docker and found it to be just really quite layered in incidental complexity, cryptic shell stuff in the DinD scripts, etc. I think if I was using Linux as my main machine, I would of course just use containers.

I also don't want to use some SaaS for remote dev boxes because that creates an enormously larger footprint. A high cost. I think I want to try some more macOS VMs.

I think the guiding light here is that macOS, like any OS, is a valid, viable computing platform. It is a viable and effective **development** platform. I don't need to toss that away. I have to pick one of the OSes, and macOS is my choice. Layering in Linux is fine, but it represents literally a doubling of OS in my dev flow. I already invest and understand and have a desire to enrich my understanding of macOS. And so, I think it's viable to explore running my agentic workloads or "dev boxes" in a macOS VM on my Mac. I think Tart is the way to go. I've been curious to just use the Apple virtualization APIs directly and writing my own CLI utility in Swift, but for now, Tart is perfectly fine. A special call out to [Lima](https://github.com/lima-vm/lima), but that's strictly focused on Linux VMs on macOS. So let's use Tart for now.

One thing I don't like about the idea of macOS on macOS is that sometimes the boundaries, from a cold start, is confusing. It's similar to server-side JavaScript or these days, React server components, where if you're waking up and the first thing you see is a tweet, blog post, or uncommitted file in your Git project, and it's TypeScript, you don't automatically know if that runs client-side or server-side. And within the same file, you don't even know what lines are running client-side or server-side (e.g. `use server` and the linke). I think isomorphic TypeScript (or anything) is super neat, but it comes with this murky boundary. "Java everywhere" was a fun idea, never happened. Still fun to think about embedded Java. It's a tradeoff. Same thing with self-bootstrapping programming languages. It's like, what are we doing? Of course you need to bootstrap from A to B. How does it make sense to bootstrap from B to B, e.g., Java compiling Java; TypeScript compiling TypeScript, etc. So I'm not sure about that type of inception. And similarly, I have a desire to learn more Linux. I'm not trying to demote it for my own forecast. But I think it might just be practical to limit it. So it's very much a secondary OS, something where I It's a runtime target for workloads, things like that. It's not a first-class development environment for me. Let's keep macOS as that. macOS is desktop only software. Appl even gave up on server-side macOS. Let that be the end of that. I'm going to try out macOS "dev box" VMs running on my macbook using Tart.
